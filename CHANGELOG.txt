Config 1.7 - 04/04/2025

Reset trigger 7 (tilt primary) to clear Polyphonic. Tilting should stop all music and other sounds.
Confirmed trigger 8 (tilt secondary) was also not polyphonic. It was correct.
Cleared re-trigger from 7 & 8 to proactively address bouncing

Adjusted the music track (1 & 2) volumes from -7 to -10 to better balance the music and the callouts

Added WAV Trigger Configuration markdown document.

Removed erroneus volume -15 from config file header by re-adjusting system volume to 0


Config 1.6 - 04/01/2025

Changed the kickout and rollover triggers to not re-trigger. Triggers 3, 4, 5, 6
They were bouncing on the solonoid monitor circuit that I built.

Changed the file range for the triggers 1, 2, 3, 4 to the full scope, not just populated number of files


Config 1.5 - 03/19/2025

Changes to accomoate my optocoupler prototype, which should go low when the solonoid fires.
Updated triggers 3,4 (kickouts) and 5,6 (rollovers) to Active hardware interface and cleared the invert flag.

Change to test if WAVtrigger finds only available track numbers.
Updated trigger 2 (alt music tracks) to be inclusive from 201-299.
